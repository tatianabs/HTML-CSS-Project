            <p>Astrology is a scientific study of influences of the planets from the Solar family on the living organisms including, human lives on Earth. Astrology begins with the study of a horoscope; created from the date, time, longitude and latitude of the place, where a life born. As the results of investigation are systematized so, it is a live science and is considered sacredly the ultimate divine power. A professional of astrology is known as an astrologer or astrologist.</p> 
            <p>What most people know about astrology is their "sign," which refers to one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac. This is a form of sun-sign astrology, which is the astrology upon which newspaper horoscopes are based. It is probably the simplest form, because nothing more than the date of someone's birthday is needed to generate a sun-sign horoscope. Many astrologers will tell you that this form of astrology is so simplistic that it produces very limited result.</p>
            <p>There is no single unified theory or practice of astrology. Ancient cultures all practiced their own forms, some of which combined and evolved into today's common western astrology. Eastern cultures continue to practice their own forms of astrology: Chinese, Vedic and Tibetan astrology are among the most well-known.</p>
